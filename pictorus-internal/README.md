# Pictorus Internal

This crate contains most of the dependencies referenced by generated code that are not part of the core traits/blocks libraries. This include things like helper functions/structs for app execution, logging, telemetry, etc. This crate is not intended to be used directly by users, but rather as a dependency for the generated code.
