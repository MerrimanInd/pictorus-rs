# Pictorus Sim

This crate contains implementations of the various drivers needed to interact with I/O in the Pictorus simulator. These are typically defined as `InputBlock` or `OutputBlock` interfaces as defined in the `pictorus-traits` crate. For the simulator, these are generally just passthrough/hardcoded values.
